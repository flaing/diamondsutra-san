  Thus have I heard at one time. The Lord dwelt at Sravasti, in the Jeta Grove, 
  in the garden of Anathapindika, together with a large gathering of monks, consisting 
  of 1,250 monks, and with many Bodhisattvas, great beings. Early in the morning 
  the Lord dressed, put on his cloak, took his bowl, and entered the great city 
  of Sravasti to collect alms. When he had eaten and returned from his round, 
  the Lord put away his bowl and cloak, washed his feet, and sat down on the seat 
  arranged for him, crossing his legs, holding his body upright, and mindfully 
  fixing his attention in front of him. Then many monks approached to where the 
  Lord was, saluted his feet with their heads, thrice walked round him to the 
  right, and sat down on one side.<br><br><br>

  At that time the Venerable Subhuti came to that assembly, and sat down. Then 
  he rose from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right 
  knee on the ground, bent forth his folded hands towards the Lord, and said to 
  the Lord: 'It is wonderful O Lord, it is exceedingly wonderful, O Well-Gone, 
  how much the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, have been helped with the greatest 
  help by the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully Enlightened One. It is wonderful, 
  O Lord, how much the Bodhisattvas, the great beings, have been favoured with 
  the highest favour by the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully Enlightened One. How 
  then, O Lord, should a son or daughter of good family, who have set out in the 
  Bodhisattva-vehicle, stand, how progress, how control their thoughts?'<br><br><br>
  
  Evam ukte Bhagavan ayusmantam Subhutim etad avocat: Sadhu sadhu Subhute, evam

  After these words the Lord said to the Venerable Subhuti: 'Well said, well said, 
  Subhuti! So it is, Subhuti, so it is, as you say! The Tathagata, Subhuti, has 
  helped the Bodhisattvas, the great beings with the greatest help, and he has 
  favoured them with the highest favour. Therefore, 'Subhuti, listen well, and 
  attentively! I will teach you how those who have set out in the Bodhisattva 
  vehicle should stand, how progress, how control their thoughts.' 'So be it, 
  O Lord', replied the Venerable Subhuti and listened.<br><br><br>
  
  Bhagavan etad avocat: Iha Subhute bodhisattva-yana-samprasthitena evam cittam 
  utpadayitavyam: Yavantah Subhute sattvah sattvadhatau sattva-samgrahena samgrhita

  Tat kasya hetoh? Sacet Subhute bodhisattvasya sattva-samjna pravarteta, na sa

  va pravarteta.<br><br>
  The Lord said: Here, Subhuti, someone who has set out in the vehicle of a Bodhisattva 
  should produce a thought in this manner: 'As many beings as there are in the 
  universe of beings, comprehended under the term &quot;beings&quot; egg-born, 
  born from a womb, moisture-born, or miraculously born; with or without form; 
  with perception, without perception, and with neither perception nor non-perception, 
  as far as any conceivable form of beings is conceived: all these I must lead 
  to Nirvana, into that Realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind. And yet, 
  although innumerable beings have thus been led to Nirvana, no being at all has 
  been led to Nirvana.' And why? If in a Bodhisattva the notion of a 'being' should 
  take place, he could not be called a 'Bodhi-being'. 'And why? He is not to be 
  called a Bodhi-being, in whom the notion of a self or of a being should take 
  place, or the notion of a living soul or of a person.'<br><br><br>
  
  Api tu khalu punah Subhute na bodhisattvena vastu-pratisthitena danam datavyam, 
  na kvacit pratisthitena danam datavyam, na-rupa-pratisthitena danam datavyam, 
  na sabda-gandha-rasa-sprastavya-dharmesu pratisthitena danam datavyam. Evam 
  hi Subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena danam datavyam yatha na nimitta-samjnayam

  Subhute punya-skandhasya na sukaram pramanam udgrahitum. Tat kim manyase Subhute

  hi Subhute bodhisattva-yana-samprasthitena danam datavyam yatha na nimitta-samjnayam 
  api pratitisthet.<br><br>
  Moreover, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva who gives a gift should not be supported by 
  a thing, nor should he be supported anywhere. When he gives gifts he should 
  not be supported by sight-objects, nor by sounds, smells, tastes, touchables, 
  or mind-objects. For, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being should give 
  gifts in such a way that he is not supported by the notion of a sign. And why? 
  Because the heap of merit of that Bodhi-being, who unsupported gives a gift, 
  is not easy to measure. What do you think, Subhuti, is the extent of space in 
  the East easy to measure? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. The Lord asked: 
  In like manner, is it easy to measure the extent of space in the South, West 
  or North, downwards, upwards, in the intermediate directions, in all the ten 
  directions all round? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. The Lord said: Even 
  so the heap of merit of that Bodhibeing who unsupported gives a gift is not 
  easy to measure. That is why, Subhuti, those who have set out in the Bodhisattva-vehicle, 
  should give gifts without being supported by the notion of a sign.<br><br><br>
  
  Tat kim manyase Subhute laksana-sampada Tathagato drastavyah? Subhutir aha: 
  No hidam Bhagavan, na laksana-sampada Tathagato drastavyah. Tat kasya hetoh? 
  Ya sa Bhagavan laksana-sampat Tathagatena bhasita saiva-alaksana-sampat. Evam 
  ukte Bhagavan ayusmantam Subhutim etad avocat: Yavat Subhute laksana-sampat 
  tavan mrsa, yavad alaksana-sampat tavan na mrseti hi laksana-alaksanatas Tathagato 
  drastavyah.<br><br>
  The Lord continued: 'What do you think, Subhuti, can the Tathagata be seen by 
  the possession of his marks?' Subhuti replied: 'No indeed, O Lord. And why? 
  What has been taught by the Tathagata as the possession of marks, that is truly 
  a no-possession of no-marks.' The Lord said: 'Wherever there is possession of 
  marks, there is fraud, wherever there is no-possession of no-marks there is 
  no fraud. Hence the Tathagata is to be seen from no marks as marks.'<br><br><br>

  Subhuti asked: Will there be any beings in the future period, in the last time, 
  in the last epoch, in the last 500 years, at the time of the collapse of the 
  good doctrine who, when these words of the Sutra are being taught, will understand 
  their truth? The Lord replied: Do not speak thus, Subhuti! Yes, even then there 
  will be such beings. For even at that time, Subhuti, there will be Bodhisattvas 
  who are gifted with good conduct, gifted, with virtuous qualities, gifted with 
  wisdom, and who, when these words of the Sutra are being taught, will understand 
  their truth. And these Bodhisattvas, Subhuti, will not be such as have honoured 
  only one single Buddha, nor such as have planted their roots of merit under 
  one single Buddha only. On the contrary, Subhuti, those Bodhisattvas who, when 
  these words of the Sutra are being taught, will find even one single thought 
  of serene faith, they will be such as have honoured many hundreds of thousands 
  of Buddhas, such as have planted their roots of merit under many hundreds of 
  thousands of Buddhas. Known they are, Subhuti, to the Tathagata through his 
  Buddha cognition, seen they are, Subhuti, by the Tathagata with his Buddha-eye, 
  fully known they are, Subhuti, to the Tathagata. And they all, Subhuti, will 
  beget and acquire an immeasurable and incalculable heap of merit.<br><br><br>
  
  Tat kasya hetoh? Na hi Subhute tesam bodhisattvanam mahasattvanam atma-samjna 
  pravartate na sattva-samjna na jiva-samjna na pudgala-samjna pravartate. Na-api 
  tesam Subhute bodhisattvanam mahasattvanam dharma-samjna pravartate, evam na-adharma-samjna. 
  Na-api tesam Subhute samjna na-asamjna pravartate.<br><br>
  And why? Because, Subhuti, in these Bodhisattvas (1) no perception of a self 
  takes place, (2) no perception of a being, (3) no perception of a soul, (4) 
  no perception of a person. Nor do these Bodhisattvas have (5) a perception of 
  a dharma, or (6) a perception of a no-dharma. (7) No perception or (8) non-perception 
  takes place in them.<br><br><br>
  
  Tat kasya hetoh? Sacet Subhute tesam bodhisattvanam mahasattvanam dharma-samjna 
  pravarteta, sa eva tesam atma-graho bhavet, sattva-graho jiva-grahah pudgala-graho 
  bhavet. Saced a-dharma-samjna pravarteta, sa eva tesam atma-graho bhavet, sattva-graho 
  jiva-grahah pudgala-graha iti. Tat kasya hetoh? Na khalu punah Subhute bodhisattvena 
  mahasattvena dharma udgrahitavyo na-adharmah. Tasmad iyam Tathagatena sandhya 
  vag bhasita: Kolopamam dharma-paryayam ajanadbhir dharma eva prahatavyah prag 
  eva-adharma iti.<br><br>
  And why? If, Subhuti, these Bodhisattvas should have a perception of either 
  a dharma, or a no-dharma, they would thereby seize on a self, a being, a soul, 
  or a person. And why? Because a Bodhisattva should not seize on either a dharma 
  or a no-dharma. Therefore this saying has been taught by the Tathagata with 
  a hidden meaning: 'Those who know the discourse on dharma as like unto a raft, 
  should forsake dharmas, still more so no-dharmas.'<br><br><br>

  The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, is there any dharma which the Tathagata 
  has fully known as 'the utmost, right and perfect enlightenment, or is there 
  any dharma which the Tathagata has demonstrated? Subhuti replied: No, not as 
  I understand what the Lord has said. And why? This dharma which the Tathagata 
  has fully known or demonstrated it cannot be grasped, it cannot be talked about, 
  it is neither a dharma nor a no-dharma. And why? Because an Absolute exalts 
  the Holy Persons.<br><br><br>
  
  Bhagavan aha: Tat kim manyase Subhute yah kascit kulaputro va kuladuhita vemam

  Tat kasya hetoh? Yo'sau Bhagavan punya-skandhas Tathagatena bhasitah, a-skandhah 
  sa Tathagatena bhasitah. Tasmat Tathagato bhasate: Punya-skandhah punya-skandha

  Buddhadharma buddhadharma iti Subhute 'buddhadharmas caiva te Tathagatena bhasitah. 
  Tenocyante buddhadharma iti.<br><br>
  The Lord then asked: What do you think, Subhuti, if a son or daughter of good 
  family had filled this world system of 1,000 million worlds with the seven precious 
  things, and then gave it as a gift to the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully Enlightened 
  Ones, would they on the strength of that beget a great heap of merit? Subbuti 
  replied: Great, O Lord, great, O Well-Gone, would that heap of merit be! And 
  why? Because the Tathagata spoke of the 'heap of merit' as a non-heap. That 
  is how the Tathagata speaks of 'heap of merit'. The Lord said: But if someone 
  else were to take from this discourse on dharma but one stanza of four lines, 
  and would demonstrate and illuminate it in full detail to others, then he would 
  on the strength of that beget a still greater heap of merit, immeasurable and 
  incalculable. And why? Because from it has issued the utmost, right and perfect 
  enlightenment of the Tathagatas, Arhats, Fully Enlightened Ones, and from it 
  have issued the Buddhas, the Lords. And why? For the Tathagata has taught that 
  the dharmas special to the Buddhas are just not a Buddha's special dharmas. 
  That is why they are called 'the dharmas special to the Buddhas'.<br><br><br>

  The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, does it occur to the Streamwinner, 
  'by me has the fruit of a Streamwinner been attained'? Subhuti replied: No indeed, 
  O Lord. And why? Because, O Lord, he has not won any dharma. Therefore is he 
  called a Stream-winner. No sight-object has been won, no sounds, smells, tastes, 
  touchables, or objects of mind. That is why he is called a 'Streamwinner'. If, 
  O Lord, it would occur to a Streamwinner, 'by me has a Streamwinner's fruit 
  been attained', then that would be in him a seizing on a self, seizing on a 
  being, seizing on a soul, seizing on a person. The Lord asked: What do you think, 
  Subhuti, does it then occur to the Once-Returner, 'by me has the fruit of a 
  Once-Returner been attained'? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. And why? Because 
  there is not any dharma that has won Once-Returnership. That is why he is called 
  a 'Once-Returner'. The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, does it then 
  occur to the Never-Returner 'by me has the fruit of a Never-Returner been attained'? 
  Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. And why? Because there is not any dharma 
  that has won Never Returnership. Therefore is he called a 'Never-Returner'. 
  The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, does it then occur to the Arhat, 
  'by me has Arhatship been attained'? Subhuti: No indeed, O Lord. And why? Because 
  no dharma is called 'Arhat'. That is why he is called an Arhat. If, O Lord, 
  it would occur to an Arhat. 'by me has Arhatship been attained', then that would 
  be in him a seizing on a self, seizing on a being, seizing on a soul, seizing 
  on a person. And why? I am, O Lord, the one whom the Tathagata, the Arhat, the 
  Fully Enlightened One has pointed out as the foremost of those who dwell in 
  Peace. I am, O Lord, an Arhat free from greed. And yet, O Lord, it does not 
  occur to me, 'an Arhat am I and free from greed'. If, O Lord, it could occur 
  to me that I have attained Arhatship, then the Tathagata would not have declared 
  of me that 'Subhuti, this son of good family, who is the foremost of those who 
  dwell in Peace, does not dwell anywhere; that is why he is called &quot;a dweller 
  in Peace, a dweller in Peace&quot;'.<br><br><br>
  
  Bhagavan aha: Tat kim manyase Subhute, asti sa kascid dharmo yas Tathagatena 
  Dipankarasya Tathagatasya-arhatah samyaksambuddhasya-antikad udgrhitah? Subhutir 
  aha: No hidam Bhagavan, na-asti sa kascid dharmo yas Tathagatena Dipankarasya 
  Tathagatasya-arhatah samyaksambuddhasya-antikad udgrhitah.<br><br>
  The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, is there any dharma which the Tathagata 
  has learned from Dipankara, the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully Enlightened 
  One? Subhuti replied: Not so, O Lord, there is not.<br><br><br>
  
  Bhagavan aha: Yah kascit Subhute bodhisattva evam vaded: Aham ksetra-vyuhan 
  nispadayisyami-iti, sa vitatham vadet. Tat kasya hetoh? Ksetra-vyuhah ksetra-vyuha 
  iti Subhute, 'vyuhas te Tathagatena bhasitah. Tenocyante ksetra-vyuha iti.<br><br>
  The Lord said: If any Bodhisattva would say, 'I will create harmonious Buddhafields', 
  he would speak falsely. And why? 'The harmonies of Buddhafields, the harmonies 
  of Buddhafields', Subhuti, as no-harmonies have they been taught by the Tathagata. 
  Therefore he spoke of 'harmonious Buddhafields'.<br><br><br>
  
  Tasmat tarhi Subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvenaivam apratisthitam cittam utpadayitavyam 
  yan na kvacit-pratisthitam cittam utpadayitavyam, na rupa-pratisthitam cittam 
  utpadayitavyam na sabda-gandha-rasa-sprastavya-dharma-pratisthitam cittam utpadayitavyam.<br><br>
  Therefore then, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva, the great being, should produce an 
  unsupported thought, i.e. a thought which is nowhere supported, a thought unsupported

  Suppose, Subhuti, there were a man endowed with a body, a huge body, so that 
  he had a personal existence like Sumeru, king of mountains. Would that, Subhuti, 
  be a huge personal existence? Subhuti replied: Yes, huge, O Lord, huge, O Well-Gone, 
  would his personal existence be. And why so? 'Personal existence, personal existence', 
  as no-existence has that been taught by the Tathagata; for not, O Lord, is that 
  existence or non-existence. Therefore is it called 'personal existence'.<br><br><br>

  The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, if there were as many Ganges rivers 
  as there are grains of sand in the large river Ganges, would the grains of sand 
  in them be many? Subhuti replied: Those Ganges rivers would indeed be many, 
  much more so the grains of sand in them. The Lord said: This is what I announce 
  to you, Subhuti, this is what I make known to you, if some woman or man had 
  filled with the seven precious things as many world systems as there are grains 
  of sand in those Ganges rivers, and would give them as a gift to the Tathagatas, 
  Arhats, fully Enlightened Ones what do you think, Subhuti, would that woman 
  or man on the strength of that beget a great heap of merit? Subhuti replied: 
  Great, O Lord, great O Well-Gone, would that heap of merit be, immeasurable 
  and incalculable. The Lord said: But if a son or daughter of good family had 
  taken from this discourse on dharma but one stanza of four lines, and were to 
  demonstrate and illuminate it to others, then they would on the strength of 
  that beget a still greater heap of merit, immeasurable and incalculable. Moreover, 
  Subhuti, that spot of earth where one has taken from this discourse on dharma 
  but one stanza of four lines, taught or illumined it, that spot of earth will 
  be a veritable shrine for the whole world with its gods, men and Asuras. What 
  then should we say of those who will bear in mind this discourse on dharma in 
  its entirety, who will recite, study, and illuminate it in full detail for others! 
  Most wonderfully blest, Subhuti, they will be! And on that spot of earth, Subhuti, 
  either the Teacher dwells, or a sage representing him.<br><br><br>

  Subhuti asked: What then, O Lord, is this discourse on dharma, and how should 
  I bear it in mind? The Lord replied: This discourse on dharma, Subhuti, is called 
  'Wisdom which has gone beyond', and as such should you bear it in mind!<br><br><br>

  And why? Just that which the Tathagata has taught as the wisdom which has gone 
  beyond, just that He has taught as not gone beyond. Therefore is it called 'Wisdom 
  which has gone beyond'. What do you think, Subhuti, is there any dharma which 
  the Tathagata has taught? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord, there is not. 
  The Lord said: When, Subhuti, you consider the number of particles of dust in 
  this world system of 1,000 million worlds-would they be many? Subhuti replied: 
  Yes, O Lord. Because what was taught as particles of dust by the Tathagata, 
  as no-particles that was taught by the Tathagata. Therefore are they called 
  'particles of dust'. And this world-system the Tathagata has taught as no-system. 
  Therefore is it called a 'world system'. The Lord asked: What do you think, 
  Subhuti, can the Tathagata be seen by means of the thirty-two marks of the superman? 
  Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. And why? Because those thirty-two marks 
  of the superman which were taught by the Tathagata, they are really no-marks. 
  Therefore are they called 'the thirty-two marks of the superman'.<br><br><br>
  
  Bhagavan aha: Yas ca khalu punah Subhute stri va puruso va dine dine Ganga-nadi-valuka-saman

  The Lord said: And again, Subhuti, suppose a woman or a man were to renounce 
  all their belongings as many times as there are grains of sand in the river 
  Ganges; and suppose that someone else, after taking from this discourse on Dharma 
  but one stanza of four lines, would demonstrate it to others. Then this latter 
  on the strength of that would beget a greater heap of merit, immeasurable and 
  incalculable.<br><br><br>

  Thereupon the impact of Dharma moved the Venerable Subhuti to tears. Having 
  wiped away his tears, he thus spoke to the Lord: It is wonderful, O Lord, it 
  is exceedingly wonderful, O Well-Gone, how well the Tathagata has taught this 
  discourse on Dharma. Through it cognition has been produced in me. Not have 
  I ever before heard such a discourse on Dharma. Most wonderfully blest will 
  be those who, when this Sutra is being taught, will produce a true perception. 
  And that which is true perception, that is indeed no perception. Therefore the 
  Tathagata teaches, 'true perception, true perceptions'. It is not difficult 
  for me to accept and believe this discourse on Dharma when it is being taught. 
  But those beings who will be in a future period, in the last time, in the last 
  epoch, in the last 500 years, at the time of the collapse of the good doctrine, 
  and who, O Lord, will take up this discourse on Dharma, bear it in mind, recite 
  it, study it, and illuminate it in full detail for others, these will be most 
  wonderfully blest. In them, however, no perception of a self will take place, 
  or of a being, a soul, or a person. And why? That, O Lord, which is perception 
  of self, that is indeed no perception. That which is perception of a being, 
  a soul or a person, that is indeed no perception. And why? Because the Buddhas, 
  the Lords have left all perceptions behind.<br><br><br>

  The Lord said: So it is, Subhuti. Most wonderfully blest will be those beings 
  who, on hearing this Sutra, will not tremble, nor be frightened, or terrified. 
  And why? The Tathagata has taught this as the highest (parama-) perfection (paramita). 
  And what the Tathagata teaches as the highest perfection, that also the innumerable 
  (aparimana) Blessed Buddhas do teach. Therefore is it called the 'highest perfection'.<br><br><br>

  Moreover, Subhuti, the Tathagata's perfection of patience is really no perfection. 
  And why? Because, Subhuti, when the king of Kalinga cut my flesh from every 
  limb, at that time I had no perception of a self, of a being, of a soul, or 
  a person. And why? If, Subhuti, at that time I had had a perception of self, 
  I would also have had a perception of ill-will at that time. And so, if I had 
  had a perception of a being, of a soul, or of a person. With my superknowledge 
  I recall that in the past I have for five hundred births led the life of a sage 
  devoted to patience. Then also have I had no perception of a self, a being, 
  a soul, or a person.<br><br><br>
  
  Tasmat tarhi Subhute bodhisattvena mahasattvena sarva-samjna-vivarjayitva-anuttarayam

  danam datavyam. Na rupa-sabda-gandha-rasa-sprastavya-dharma-pratisthitena danam 
  datavyam.<br><br>
  Therefore then, Subhuti, the Bodhi-being, the great being, after he has got 
  rid of all perceptions, should raise his thought to the utmost, right and perfect 
  enlightenment. He should produce a thought which is unsupported by forms, sounds, 
  smells, tastes, touchables, or mind-objects, unsupported by dharma, unsupported 
  by no-dharma, unsupported by anything. And why? All supports have actually no 
  support. It is for this reason that the Tathagata teaches: By an unsupported 
  Bodhisattva should a gift be given, not by one who is supported by forms, sounds, 
  smells, tastes, touchables, or mind-objects.<br><br><br>
  
  Api tu khalu punah Subhute bodhisattvenaivamrupo dana-parityagah kartavyah sarva-sattvanam

  Bhuta-vadi Subhute Tathagatah satyavadi tathavady ananyathavadi Tathagatah. 
  Na vitatha-vadi Tathagatah.<br><br>
  And further, Subhuti, it is for the weal of all beings that a Bodhisattva should 
  give gifts in this manner. And why? This perception of a being, Subhuti, that 
  is just a non-perception. Those all-beings of whom the Tathagata has spoken, 
  they are indeed no-beings. And why? Because the Tathagata speaks in accordance 
  with reality, speaks the truth, speaks of what is, not otherwise. A Tathagata 
  does not speak falsely.<br><br><br>
  
  Api tu khalu punah Subhute yas Tathagatena dharmo 'bhisambuddho desito nidhyato,

  But nevertheless, Subhuti, with regard to that dharma which the Tathagata has 
  fully known and demonstrated, on account of that there is neither truth nor 
  fraud.<br>
  In darkness a man could not see anything. Just so should be viewed a Bodhisattva 
  who has fallen among things, and who, fallen among things, renounces a gift. 
  A man with eyes would, when the night becomes light and the sun has arisen, 
  see manifold forms. Just so should be viewed a Bodhisattva who has not fallen 
  among things, and who, without having fallen among things, renounces a gift.<br><br><br>

  Furthermore, Subhuti, those sons and daughters of good family who will take 
  up this discourse on Dharma, will bear it in mind, recite, study, and illuminate 
  it in full detail for others, they have been known, Subhuti, by the Tathagata 
  with his Buddha-cognition, they have been seen, Subhuti, by the Tathagata with 
  his Buddha-eye, they have been fully known by the Tathagata. All these beings, 
  Subhuti, will beget and acquire an immeasurable and incalculable heap of merit. 
  And if, Subhuti, a woman or man should renounce in the morning all their belongings 
  as many times as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, and if they should 
  do likewise at noon and in the evening, and if in this way they should renounce 
  all their belongings for many hundreds of thousands of millions of milliards 
  of aeons; and someone else, on hearing this discourse on Dharma, would not reject 
  it; then the latter would on the strength of that beget a greater heap of merit, 
  immeasurable and incalculable. What then should we say of him who, after writing 
  it, would learn it, bear it in mind, recite, study and illuminate it in full 
  detail for others?<br><br><br>

  Moreover, Subhuti, (1) unthinkable and (2) incomparable is this discourse on 
  Dharma. (3) The Tathagata has taught it for the weal of beings who have set 
  out in the best, in the most excellent vehicle. Those who will take up this 
  discourse on Dharma, bear it in mind, recite, study and illuminate it in full 
  detail for others, the Tathagata has known them with his Buddha-cognition, the 
  Tathagata has seen them with his Buddha-eye, the Tathagata has fully known them. 
  All these beings, Subhuti, will be blest with an immeasurable heap of merit, 
  they will be blest with a heap of merit unthinkable, incomparable, measureless 
  and illimitable. All these beings, Subhuti, will carry along an equal share 
  of enlightenment. And why? (4) Because it is not possible, Subhuti, that this 
  discourse on Dharma could be heard by beings of inferior resolve, nor by such 
  as have a self in view, a being, a soul, or a person. Nor can beings who have 
  not taken the pledge of Bodhi-beings either hear this discourse on Dharma, or 
  take it up, bear it in mind, recite or study it. That cannot be.<br><br><br>

  (1) Moreover, Subhuti, the spot of earth where this Sutra will be revealed, 
  that spot of earth will be worthy of worship by the whole world with its Gods, 
  men and Asuras, worthy of being saluted respectfully, worthy of being honoured 
  by circumambulation, like a shrine will be that spot of earth. And yet Subhuti, 
  those sons and daughters of good family, who will take up these very Sutras, 
  and will bear them in mind, recite and study them, they will be humbled, well 
  humbled they will be! And why? The impure deeds which these beings have done 
  in their former lives, and which are liable to lead them into the states of 
  woe, in this very life they will, by means of that humiliation, (2) annul those 
  impure deeds of their former lives, and (3) they will reach the enlightenment 
  of a Buddha. <br>
  With my superknowledge, Subhuti, I recall that in the past period, long before 
  Dipankara, the Tathagata, Arhat, fully Enlightened One, during incalculable, 
  quite incalculable aeons, I gave satisfaction by loyal service to 84,000 million 
  milliards of Buddhas, without ever becoming again estranged from them. But the 
  heap of merit, Subhuti, from the satisfaction I gave to those Buddhas and Lords 
  without again becoming estranged from them compared with the heap of merit of 
  those who in the last time, the last epoch, the last five hundred years, at 
  the time of the collapse of the good doctrine, will take up these very Sutras,

  for others, it does not approach one hundredth part, not one thousandth part, 
  nor a one hundred thousandth part, not a ten millionth part, nor a one hundred 
  millionth part, nor a 100,000 millionth part. It does not bear number, nor fraction, 
  nor counting, nor similarity, nor comparison, nor resemblance. (4) If moreover, 
  Subhuti, I were to teach, the heap of merit of those sons and daughters of good 
  family, and how great a heap of merit they will at that time beget and acquire, 
  beings would become frantic and confused. Since, however, Subhuti, the Tathagata 
  has taught this discourse on Dharma as unthinkable, so just an unthinkable karma 
  result should be expected from it.<br><br><br>

  [(Subhuti asked: How, O Lord, should one set out in the Bodhisattva-vehicle 
  stand, how progress, how control his thoughts? The Lord replied: Here, Subhuti, 
  someone who has set out in the Bodhisattva-vehicle should produce a thought 
  in this manner: 'all beings I must lead to Nirvana, into that Realm of Nirvana 
  which leaves nothing behind; and yet, after beings have thus been led to Nirvana, 
  no being at all has been led to Nirvana'. And why? If in a Bodhisattva the notion 
  of a 'being' should take place, he could not be called a 'Bodhi-being'. And 
  likewise if the notion of a soul, or a person should take place in him.)] And 
  why? He who has set out in the Bodhisattva-vehicle he is not one of the dharmas.<br><br><br>

  What do you think Subhuti, is there any dharma by which the Tathagata, when 
  he was with Dipankara the Tathagata, has fully known the utmost, right and perfect 
  enlightenment? Subhuti replied: There is not any dharma by which the Tathagata, 
  when he was with the Tathagata Dipankara, has fully known the utmost, right 
  and perfect enlightenment. The Lord said: It is for this reason that the Tathagata 
  Dipankara then predicted of me: 'You, young Brahmin, will be in a future period 
  a Tathagata, Arhat, fully Enlightened, by the name of Shakyamuni!'<br><br><br>

  And why? 'Tathagata', Subhuti, is synonymous with true Suchness (tathata). And 
  whosoever, Subhuti, were to say, 'The Tathagata has fully known the utmost, 
  right and perfect enlightenment', he would speak falsely. And why? [(There is 
  not any dharma by which the Tathagata has fully known the utmost, right and 
  perfect enlightenment. And that dharma which the Tathagata has fully known and 
  demonstrated, on account of that there is neither truth nor fraud.)] Therefore 
  the Tathagata teaches, all dharmas are the Buddha's own and special dharmas'. 
  And why? 'All-dharmas', Subhuti, have as no-dharmas been taught by the Tathagata. 
  Therefore all dharmas are called the Buddha's own and special dharmas. [(Just 
  as a man, Subhuti, might be endowed with a body, a huge body.)] Subhuti said: 
  That man of whom the Tathagata spoke as 'endowed with a body, a huge body', 
  as a no-body he has been taught by the Tathagata. Therefore is he called, 'endowed 
  with a body, a huge body'.<br><br><br>

  The Lord said: So it is, Subhuti. The Bodhisattva who would say, I will lead 
  beings to Nirvana', he should not be called a 'Bodhi-being'. And why? Is there, 
  Subhuti, any dharma named 'Bodhi-being'? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. 
  The Lord said: Because of that the Tathagata teaches, 'selfless are all dharmas, 
  they have not the character of living beings, they are without a living soul, 
  without personality'. [(If any Bodhisattva should say, 'I will create harmonious 
  Buddhafields')], he likewise should not be called a Bodhi-being. [(And why? 
  'The harmonies of Buddhafields, the harmonies of Buddhafields', Subhuti, as 
  no-harmonies have they been taught by the Tathagata. Therefore he spoke of 'harmonious 
  Buddhafields'.)] The Bodhisattva, however, Subhuti, who is intent on 'without 
  self are the dharmas, without self are the dharmas', him the Tathagata, the 
  Arhat, the fully Enlightened One has declared to be a Bodhi-being, a great being.<br><br><br>

  What do you think, Subhuti, does the fleshly eye of the Tathagata exist? Subhuti 
  replied: So it is, O Lord, the fleshly eye of the Tathagata does exist. The 
  Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, does the Tathagata's heavenly eye exist, 
  his wisdom eye, his Dharma-eye, his Buddha-eye? Subhuti replied: So it is, O 
  Lord, the heavenly eye of the Tathagata does exist, and so does his wisdom eye, 
  his Dharma-eye and his Buddha-eye. <br><br><br>

  The Lord said: What do you think, Subhuti, has the Tathagata used the phrase, 
  'as many grains of sand as there are in the great river Ganges'? Subhuti replied: 
  So it is, O Lord, so it is, O Well-Gone! The Tathagata has done so. The Lord 
  asked: What do you think, Subhuti, if there were as many Ganges rivers as there 
  are grains of sand in the great river Ganges, and if there were as many world 
  systems as there are grains of sand in them, would those world systems be many? 
  Subhuti replied: So it is, O Lord, so it is, O Well-Gone, these world systems 
  would be many. The Lord said: As many beings as there are in these world systems, 
  of them I know, in my wisdom, the manifold trends of thought. And why? 'Trends 
  of thought, trends of thought', Subhuti, as no trends have they been taught 
  by the Tathagata. Therefore are they called 'trends of thought'. And why? Past 
  thought is not got at; future thought is not got at; present thought is not 
  got at.<br><br><br>

  What do you think, Subhuti, if a son or daughter of good family had filled this 
  world system of 1,000 million worlds with the seven precious things, and then 
  gave it as a gift to the Tathagatas, the Arhats, the fully Enlightened Ones, 
  would they on the strength of that beget a great heap of merit? Subhuti replied: 
  they would, O Lord, they would, O Well-Gone! The Lord said: So it is, Subhuti, 
  so it is. On the strength of that this son or daughter of good family would 
  beget a great heap of merit, immeasurable and incalculable. But if, on the other 
  hand, there were such a thing as a heap of merit, the Tathagata would not have 
  spoken of a 'heap of merit'.<br><br><br>

  What do you think, Subhuti, is the Tathagata to be seen by means of the accomplishment 
  of his form-body? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord, the Tathagata is not to 
  be seen by means of the accomplishment of his form-body. And why? 'Accomplishment 
  of his form-body, accomplishment of his form-body', this, O Lord, has been taught 
  by the Tathagata as no-accomplishment. Therefore is it called 'accomplishment 
  of his form-body'. The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, is the Tathagata 
  to be seen through his possession of marks? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. 
  And why? This possession of marks, O Lord, which has been taught by the Tathagata, 
  as a no-possession of no-marks this has been taught by the Tathagata. Therefore 
  is it called 'possession of marks'.<br><br><br>

  The Lord asked: What do you think, Subhuti, does it occur to the Tathagata, 
  'by me has Dharma been demonstrated'? Whosoever, Subhuti, would say, 'the Tathagata 
  has demonstrated Dharma', he would speak falsely, he would misrepresent me by 
  seizing on what is not there. And why? 'Demonstration of dharma, demonstration 
  of dharma', Subhuti, there is not any dharma which could be got at as a demonstration 
  of dharma.<br><br><br>

  Subhuti asked: Are there, O Lord, any beings in the future, in the last time, 
  in the last epoch, in the last 500 years, at the time of the collapse of the 
  good doctrine who, on hearing such dharmas, will truly believe? The Lord replied: 
  They, Subhuti, are neither beings nor no-beings. And why? 'Beings, beings', 
  Subhuti, the Tathagata has taught that they are all no-beings. Therefore has 
  he spoken of 'all beings'.<br><br><br>

  What do you think, Subhuti, is there any dharma by which the Tathagata has fully 
  known the utmost, right and perfect enlightenment? Subhuti replied: No indeed, 
  O Lord, there is not any dharma by which the Tathagata has fully known the utmost, 
  right and perfect enlightenment. The Lord said: So it is, Subhuti, so it is. 
  Not even the least (anu) dharma is there found or got at. Therefore is it called 
  'utmost (anuttara), right and perfect enlightenment'. Furthermore, Subhuti, 
  self-identical (sama) is that dharma, and nothing is therein at variance (vishama). 
  Therefore is it called 'utmost, right (samyak) and perfect (sam-) enlightenment'. 
  Self-identical through the absence of a self, a being, a soul, or a person, 
  the utmost, right and perfect enlightenment is fully known as the totality of 
  all the wholesome dharmas. 'Wholesome dharmas, wholesome dharmas', Subhuti yet 
  as no-dharmas have they been taught by the Tathagata. Therefore are they called 
  'wholesome dharmas'.<br><br><br>

  And again, Subhuti, if a woman or man had piled up the seven precious things 
  until their bulk equaled that of all the Sumerus, kings of mountains, in the 
  world system of 1,000 million worlds, and would give them as a gift; and if, 
  on the other hand, a son or daughter of good family would take up from this 
  Prajnaparamita, this discourse on Dharma, but one stanza of four lines, and 
  demonstrate it to others, compared with his heap of merit the former heap of 
  merit does not approach one hundredth part, etc., until we come to, it will 
  not bear any comparison.<br><br><br>

  What do you think, Subhuti, does it occur to a Tathagata, 'by me have beings 
  been set free'? Not thus should you see it, Subhuti! And why? There is not any 
  being whom the Tathagata has set free. Again, if there had been any being whom 
  the Tathagata had set free, then surely there would have been on the part of 
  the Tathagata a seizing of a self, of a being, of a soul, of a person. 'Seizing 
  of a self', as a no-seizing, Subhuti, has that been taught by the Tathagata. 
  And yet the foolish common people have seized upon it. 'Foolish common people', 
  Subhuti, as really no people have they been taught by the Tathagata. Therefore 
  are they called 'foolish common people'.<br><br>

  What do you think, Subhuti, is the Tathagata to be seen by means of his possession 
  of marks? Subhuti replied: No indeed, O Lord. The Lord said: If, Subhuti, the 
  Tathagata could be recognized by his possession of marks, then also the universal 
  monarch would be a Tathagata. Therefore the Tathagata is not to be seen by means 
  of his possession of marks. Subhuti then said: As I, O Lord, understand the 
  Lord's teaching, the Tathagata is not to be seen through his possession of marks. 
  Further the Lord taught on that occasion the following stanzas:<br>
  Ye mam rupena ca-adraksur<br>
  Ye mam ghosena ca-anvayuh<br>
  Mithya-prahana-prasrta<br>
  Na mam draksyanti te janah</b></p>

<p>From the Dharma should one see the Buddhas,<br>
  From the Dharmabodies comes their guidance.<br>
  Yet Dharma's true nature cannot be discerned,<br>
  And no one can be conscious of it as an object.<br>

  What do you think, Subhuti, has the Tathagata fully known the utmost, right 
  and perfect enlightenment through his possession of marks? Not so should you 
  see it, Subhuti. And why? Because the Tathagata could surely not have fully 
  known the utmost, right and perfect enlightenment through his possession of 
  marks.<br><br><br>

  Nor should anyone, Subhuti, say to you, 'those who have set out in the Bodhisattva-vehicle 
  have conceived the destruction of a dharma, or its annihilation'. Not so should 
  you see it, Subhuti! For those who have set out in the Bodhisattva-vehicle have 
  not conceived the destruction of a dharma, or its annihilation.<br><br>

  And again, Subhuti, if a son or daughter of good family had filled with the 
  seven precious things as many world systems as there are grains of sand in the 
  river Ganges, and gave them as a gift to the Tathagatas, Arhats, fully Enlightened 
  Ones, and if on the other hand a Bodhisattva would gain the patient acquiescence 
  in dharmas which are nothing of themselves and which fail to be produced, then 
  this latter would on the strength of that beget a greater heap of merit, immeasurable 
  and incalculable.<br><br><br>

  Ayusman Subhutir aha: Nanu Bhagavan bodhisattvena punyaskandhah parigrahitavyah? 
  Bhagavan aha: Parigrahitavyah Subhute nodgrahitavyah. Tenocyate parigrahitavya 
  iti.<br><br>
  Moreover, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva should not acquire a heap of merit. Subhuti 
  said: Surely, O Lord, the Bodhisattva should acquire a heap of merit? The Lord 
  said: 'Should acquire', Subhuti, not 'should seize upon.' Therefore is it said, 
  'should acquire'.<br><br><br>
  
  Api tu khalu punah Subhute yah kascid evam vadet: Tathagato gacchati vagacchati 
  va, tisthati va nisidati va sayyam va kalpayati, na me Subhute sa bhasitasya-artham 
  ajanati. Tat kasya hetoh? Tathagata iti Subhute ucyate na kvacid-gato na kutascid 
  agatah. Tenocyate Tathagato 'rhan samyaksambuddha iti.<br><br>
  Whosoever says that the Tathagata goes or comes, stands, sits or lies down, 
  he does not understand the meaning of my teaching. And why? 'Tathagata' is called 
  one who has not gone anywhere, nor come from anywhere. Therefore is he called 
  'the Tathagata, the Arhat, the fully Enlightened One'.<br><br><br>
  
  Yas ca khalu punah Subhute kulaputro va kuladuhita va yavantas trisahasra-mahasahasre 
  lokadhatau prthivi-rajamsi tavatam lokadhatunam evamrupam masim kuryat yavad 
  evam asamkhyeyena viryena tad yathapi nama paramanu-samcayah, tat kim manyase 
  Subhute api nu bahuh sa paramanu-samcayo bhavet? Subhutir aha: Evam etat Bhagavann, 
  evam etat Sugata, bahuh sa paramanu-samcayo bhavet. Tat kasya hetoh? Saced Bhagavan 
  bahuh paramanu-samcayo 'bhavisyat, na Bhagavan avaksyat paramanu-samcaya iti. 
  Tat kasya hetoh? Yo 'sau Bhagavan paramanu-samcayas Tathagatena bhasitah, a-samcayah 
  sa Tathagatena bhasitah. Tenocyate paramanu-samcaya iti. <br><br>
  And again, Subhuti, if a son or daughter of good family were to grind as many 
  world systems as there are particles of dust in this great world system of 1,000 
  million worlds, as finely as they can be ground with incalculable vigour, and 
  in fact reduce them to something like a collection of atomic quantities, what 
  do you think, Subhuti, would that be an enormous collection of atomic quantities? 
  Subhuti replied: So it is, O Lord, so it is, O Well-Gone, enormous would that 
  collection of atomic quantities be! And why? If, O Lord, there had been an enormous 
  collection of atomic quantities, the Lord would not have called it an 'enormous 
  collection of atomic quantities'. And why? What was taught by the Tathagata 
  as a 'collection of atomic quantities', as a no-collection that was taught by 
  the Tathagata. Therefore is it called a 'collection of atomic quantities'.<br><br><br>
  
  Yas ca Tathagatena bhasitas trisahasramahasahasro lokadhatur iti, a-dhatuh sa 
  Tathagatena bhasitah. Tenocyate trisahasramahasahasro lokadhatur iti. Tat kasya 
  hetoh? Saced Bhagavan loka-dhatur abhavisyat, sa eva pinda-graho 'bhavisyat, 
  yas caiva pinda-grahas Tathagatena bhasitah, a-grahah sa Tathagatena bhasitah. 
  Tenocyate pinda-graha iti. Bhagavan aha: Pinda-grahas caiva Subhute 'vyavaharo 
  'nabhilapyah. Na sa dharmo na-adharmah, sa ca balaprthagjanair udgrhitah.<br><br>
  And what the Tathagata taught as 'the world system of 1,000 million worlds', 
  that he has taught as a no-system. Therefore is it called 'the world system 
  of 1,000 million worlds'. And why? If, O Lord, there had been a world system, 
  that would have been a case of seizing on a material object, and what was taught 
  as 'seizing on a material object' by the Tathagata, just as a no-seizing was 
  that taught by the Tathagata. Therefore is it called 'seizing on a material 
  object'. The Lord added: And also, Subhuti, that 'seizing on a material object' 
  is a matter of linguistic convention, a verbal expression without factual content. 
  It is not a dharma nor a no-dharma. And yet the foolish common people have seized 
  upon it.<br><br><br>
  
  Tat kasya hetoh? Yo hi kascit Subhuta evam vaded: Atma-drstis Tathagatena bhasita 
  sattva-drstir jiva-drstih pudgala-drstis Tathagatena bhasita, api nu sa Subhute 
  samyagvadamano vadet? Subhuti aha: No hidam Bhagavan no hidam Sugata, na samyag-vadamano 
  vadet. Tat kasya hetoh? Ya sa Bhagavann atma-drstis Tathagatena bhasita, a-drstih 
  sa Tathagatena bhasita. Tenocyata atma-drstir iti. Bhagavan aha: Evam hi Subhute 
  bodhisattva-yana-samprasthitena sarva-dharma jnatavya drastavya adhimoktavyah. 
  Tatha ca jnatavya drastavya adhimoktavyah yatha na dharma-samjna pratyupasthahe. 
  Tat kasya hetoh? Dharma-samjna dharma-samjneti Subhute a-samjnaisa Tathagatena 
  bhasita. Tenocyate dharma-samjneti.<br><br>
  And why? Because whosoever would say that the view of a self has been taught 
  by the Tathagata, the view of a being, the view of a living soul, the view of 
  a person, would he, Subhuti, be speaking right? Subhuti replied: No indeed, 
  O Lord, no indeed, O Well-Gone, he would not be speaking right. And why? That 
  which has been taught by the Tathagata as 'view of self', as a no-view has that 
  been taught by the Tathagata. Therefore is it called 'view of self'. The Lord 
  said: It is thus, Subhuti, that someone who has set out in the Bodhisattva-vehicle 
  should know all dharmas, view them, be intent on them. And he should know, view 
  and be intent on them in such a way that he does not set up the perception of 
  a dharma. And why? 'Perception of dharma, perception of dharma, 'Subhuti, as 
  no-perception has this been taught by the Tathagata. Therefore is it called 
  'perception of dharma'.<br><br><br>
  
  Yas ca khalu punah Subhute bodhisattva mahasattvo 'prameyan asamkhyeyaml lokadhatun 
  saptaratna-paripurnam krtva Tathagatebhyo 'rhadbhyah samyaksambuddhebhyo danam 
  dadyat, yas ca kulaputro va kuladuhita vetah prajnapara-mitaya dharmaparyayad 
  antasas catuspadikam api gatham udgrhya dharayed desayed vacayet paryavapnuyat 
  parebhyas ca vistarena samprakasayed, ayam eva tato nidanam bahutaram punyaskandham 
  prasunuyad aprameyam asamkhyeyam. Katham ca samprakasayet? Yatha na prakasayet. 
  Tenocyate samprakasayed iti.<br><br>
  And finally, Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva, a great being had filled world-systems 
  immeasurable and incalculable with the seven precious things, and gave them 
  as a gift to the Tathagatas, the Arhats, the fully Enlightened Ones, and if, 
  on the other hand, a son or daughter of good family had taken from this Prajnaparamita, 
  this discourse on Dharma, but one stanza of four lines, and were to bear it 
  in mind, demonstrate, recite and study it, and illuminate it in full detail 
  for others, on the strength of that this latter would beget a greater heap of 
  merit, immeasurable and incalculable. And how would he illuminate it? So as 
  not to reveal. Therefore is it said, 'he would illuminate'.<br><br><br>

  Thus spoke the Lord. Enraptured, the Elder Subhuti, the monks and nuns, the 
  pious laymen and laywomen, and the Bodhisattvas, and the whole world with its 
  Gods, men, Asuras and Gandharvas rejoiced in the Lord's teaching.
